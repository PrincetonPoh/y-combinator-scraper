Yuma,https://yuma.ai,ChatGPT for customer support,"['W23', 'Active', 'Generative AI', 'SaaS', 'Customer Support', 'AI Assistant', 'AI']","['https://www.linkedin.com/company/yuma-ai/', 'https://twitter.com/yuma_dot_ai']",2023,2,San Francisco,['Guillaume Luccisano'],"[{'name': 'Guillaume Luccisano', 'social_media_links': ['https://twitter.com/luckwi', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumeluccisano/']}]","## What is Yuma?

Yuma is using LLMs to automate customer support. We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.
  
## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?

There are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.

But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.

Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.

## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:

First and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.

By coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.

By using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.

Yuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.

Finally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.

## Fun Fact

Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again."

It‚Äôs extremely time consuming and expensive to build out robot process automations using traditional tools like UiPath (~$66,000 per yearly license - Yikes!) not to mention the initial consultant setup fees which most people are forced to pay if they don‚Äôt have them in house (at the lowest end we‚Äôre talking $50,000+ per project - Double Yikes!!)



üí° Our Solution: Lasso makes it 10X cheaper and faster to build any robotic process automation on chrome.

We‚Äôre solving this by creating a platform that enables robotics process automation for Chrome using large language models and computer vision.

Currently our customers send us descriptions of the processes they‚Äôd like us to automate and we use our internal tooling to quickly build out those automations.

Here is one of our customer‚Äôs attended bots in action, scraping an email, looking through a prospecting tool, and saving it to a spreadsheet.

We want to let anyone regardless of timeline or budget automate the work they do by using natural language or simply sending Lasso the workflow they want to automate in a screen recording.

By teaching our body‚Äôs immune system to recognize and kill the mutations that cause cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths.

A little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn‚Äôt recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 25-30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually ‚Äì preventing the majority of cancer deaths. 

Our team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden‚Äôs Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition).

We‚Äôve already consolidated tens of thousands of rental units, helping lenders underwrite loans for the 60 million thin-credit borrowers in the U.S.

There are over 300 million loan originations annually in the U.S., and lenders pay $15-$200 per loan for underwriting data. In 2021, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other financial institutions included rent payments data in their underwriting models to expand access to credit. However, no solution exists to provide this data to these lenders at scale.

Trigo is a federally regulated Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) that provides this missing rent data set to lenders through a real-time API. We‚Äôve already consolidated over 40,000 units to provide instant data to lenders. Where we don‚Äôt yet have data coverage, we automate outreach to landlords for our lenders.

By eliminating the distinction between what is building a spreadsheet and what is writing code we remove the upper limit of what can be done with spreadsheets and turn them into an app development platform, while retaining their ease of getting started.

- All the process of compensation data submission is automatic and needs no manual intervention

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day.

This isn't drones for burritos though, unless you want literally tons of burritos! We are addressing heavy payloads - the hardest stuff to fly electrically. 

Whether you‚Äôre in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown. Electric aircraft could be a solution for lowering cost, but we‚Äôre stuck with small payloads and low range for many years to come. So for the hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or inter-island communities that could benefit the most, the electric aviation revolution just isn‚Äôt coming. Unless...

Without requiring FAA certification or integration into formal airspace, Seaflight‚Äôs simple uncrewed ""ground effect"" craft will enable high value, time-sensitive cargo to be flown overwater, point-to-point between coastal communities at 10x the speed of a ship, with triple the margin of conventional air freight, and almost double the range or payload of a conventional electric aircraft. Express air cargo continues to grow at double digit pace, it's time to deliver it in the most efficient way possible for cost and climate. 

*You won‚Äôt find impossible machines here*

1) We have prototype early flying hardware (at 20% scale) with autopilot for sustained low altitude flight, built and developed entirely in-house.
2) We‚Äôre actively working with the Coast Guard and branches of the armed forces to be able to safely test and develop our systems and operations in controlled ways, to reduce risk - but if the US moves slowly, we have an MoU for unrestricted testing in Europe. 
3) After that we‚Äôll partner with an existing logistics operation to fly initial routes that are not heavily trafficked by ships, to build up our reliability and safety before scaling to other markets.

Once a user‚Äôs Notebook account is created they can begin proving their humanity and aggregating their credentials across wallets.

Notebook can be used to increase the safety of DeFi, governance, and airdrops.

Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. 

The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:

(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.

(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.

(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.

Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that‚Äôs 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M."

Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. 

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Until Sunlight.

With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.

No centralized exchanges, clearinghouses, depositories, clearing banks, CSD participants etc. required.

We are starting with cryptocurrency options first, with the intention to move towards other crypto derivatives and traditional finance derivatives eventually.

For example, one can buy a bitcoin hedging token directly from EthosX without involving any exchange or counterparty and earn profits when the bitcoin price is falling (similar to a put option). It is perpetual and is completely on-chain, end-to-end. It is held as a token in wallets and can be sold/transferred to anyone at any time.

At institutional level, using EthosX‚Äôs options infrastructure two hedge funds can trade high-value on-chain options with each other directly without involving any banks or brokers with zero counterparty risk and zero settlement risk.

We are also providing derivatives infrastructure to other crypto companies who want to use these products as a part of a larger package to their customers.

Global derivatives ecosystem is broken. Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries. Crypto was supposed to be free of these issues and a solution to all of this, but it is itself getting more and more centralized with disastrous consequences.

**Team**

Yo and Misato have previously built a retail-tech company together and sold it for $20M to Rakuten. Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.
Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**

70% of the Japanese 100 billion software market is spent on customized development!

However, Japan is not alone when it comes to customizing the legacy ERP system in a large enterprise.

Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.

On top of this, whether it‚Äôs from global or local vendors, most ERP users are frustrated with:

- Clunky and complicated UI
- Too many features that you‚Äôll never use
- Too less features that you actually need
- Poor 3rd party integration options
- No transparency / black box system
- Just super expensive

**The Solution**

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

- Faster development
- Reduced maintenance cost
- Well-documented backend APIs

Tailor‚Äôs key capabilities:

- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development
- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises
- Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process
- Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow"

As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3‚Äô end. This assures not only 3‚Äô homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3‚Äô end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna‚Äôs powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application."

NFTs are the fastest growing space within web3, yet it‚Äôs still far too hard for developers to embed NFTs into their apps. With NFT activity moving across chains, and NFTs being used for an exploding number of use cases, this complexity is only growing.

We abstract away all this complexity, and allow our customers to focus on building best in class experiences for their end users. Join us if you're excited at being at the forefront of the NFT and web3 revolution."

NICUs are time sensitive wards in the hospital, time is everything and yet nurses today continue to prepare frozen milk for infants in what's known as the milk shift. A shift where the nurse spends the day defrosting milk for the next shift of nurses. Our tech is now fully peer reviewed and published, yielding safe and reliable results in over 20 hospitals in the New York Tri-State. The company is headed by Vansh Langer MD, a physician (Windsor University, University of Chicago) and Blanca Aguilar Uscanga PhD, a Bioengineering/Food Science PhD (University of Guadalajara /Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenier√≠as (CUCEI)) team that has over 50 published works in the field between them and are experts in the science of infant nutrition.

This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, ""unofficial"", system: Slack's shared channels.

This causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.

With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions."

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler‚Äôs sales representatives (who sometimes don‚Äôt even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

It's not about mimicking employees performing isolated tasks. It's about designing a new workflow, integrated with the company's technological stack and systems.

By referencing data schemas, JumpWire labels select properties inside data payloads and transforms the raw data into a protected format, using encryption, tokenization or masking. JumpWire‚Äôs approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization‚Äôs existing InfoSec program.

JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers‚Äô own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself.

The future of infrastructure is both distributed and resilient. And none of it is possible without financing new hardware."

Brandon and Mina both have engineering degrees, and are building Flightcontrol to solve those same problems we personally experienced as consultants.

By saving in USD or digital dollars, and spending as they go in local currencies, they won't be subject to inflation.

Problem:
East Africa is home to 500 million people, with a median age of 18, growing at ~3% annually. Favourable demographics and population growth, compounded with GDP growth of ~6 - 8% underpin a fast-growing middle class.

Nonetheless, East African currencies depreciate 15 - 20% per annum on average - this is the biggest impediment to wealth protection and creation for this middle class.

Solution:
We offer the middle class access to high-APY savings in stable currencies and financial services that enable consumers to spend as they go in local currencies. We do this using both banking infrastructure and Web3.

Motivation:
Being from countries with volatile currencies, we have seen family and friends lose large portions of their savings to inflation - this is what fuels our passion about this problem and what motivates us to build Bloom."

Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. 

Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.

üî• Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

üë®‚Äçüè´ Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we‚Äôve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

üöÄ Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. "

We accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property.

Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise.

Currently available approaches for creating drugs work on the principle of finding one drug-one protein 'magic bullets'. However, diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity are often the result of several dysregulated proteins across many distinct biological pathways. 

We are building a computational-experimental platform to design therapeutics that can target several disease-causing proteins at once. By designing multi-specific drugs, we are able to create therapeutics that are more efficacious and safer than existing medicines.

At Protex AI, we‚Äôre on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We‚Äôre building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.

ü§ï The Problem:
Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.

Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.

‚úÖ Problem Solved:
Protex AI‚Äôs platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.

The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.

Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer‚Äôs facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.

HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.

The tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place."

This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).
 
We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.

This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.

We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).

In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile."

Varos is pioneering a new category of data analytics that‚Äôs challenging traditional taboos around cross-company collaboration. Varos‚Äô platform helps its users understand their own performance vs. direct competitors by unlocking data that is currently stored in different silos. In fact, a growing base of hundreds of users are already automatically feeding marketing data to Varos‚Äô platform, and in return seeing how they stack up against others in their space and stage. However, Varos is not planning to stop there, and is already planning its expansion across additional operative departments, such as finance, product, and sales.

Companies today are flying blind because they only rely on their own historical data and don‚Äôt know how their metrics compare to their competitors.

Varos increases revenue for our users by accurately showing them how their metrics compare against similar companies so they can decide which KPIs to double down on and which to spend time fixing."

By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.
 
REGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¬º-scale, 400 lb, flying demonstration vehicle and a full-scale wing test section. By 2024, REGENT will fly humans on the first full-scale prototype seaglider.  By mid-decade, REGENT‚Äôs customers - airlines and ferry companies ‚Äì will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.

In just two years, REGENT has accumulated $8B in provisional orders (including firm deposits) proving the potential of the $25B+ initial market. 
 
REGENT, a team of 40, is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker.  REGENT has raised $50M to date from the likes of Thiel Capital, Founders Fund, Mark Cuban, Y Combinator, and includes strategic investment from Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Mesa Airlines."

Despite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.

Nick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are. We are working to make sure that people like Nick‚Äôs family have access to best-in-class addiction treatment so they can get and stay well. "

Unlike Rent the Runway, we don‚Äôt handle any inventory or deal with cleaning the items. Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn‚Äôt have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. 

Advantages to our P2P model

- Entrepreneur-led
    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of ‚Äútop renters‚Äù
- More variety in inventory
    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet
- Better margins
    - we don‚Äôt touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items
    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don‚Äôt handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition

Available as Open Source & Enterprise. By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues but at least 20%. 

1. Lightning Fast
We are on the mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  
a) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. 
b) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  
c) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

Loading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  
a) Walmart found that for every 1 second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  
b) Increase of conversion % at each stage of Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) 

2. Fast Time To Value
Vue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those API‚Äôs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. 

Also, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. 

3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS
Headless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. 

It allows business users to edit the content & publish with no-code approach

4. Fast learning curve for developers  
We use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!

Hospitals are overburdened with no resources to provide care to their chronic patients once they leave the hospital. For instance, in India, there are only 2200 oncologists for 1.38 billion people. Patients travel 100 miles waiting for hours to get few minutes with the doctors. They have no easy means to manage all the toxicities and symptoms they get once they are back home. This leads to 6X lower patient retention, 4X high emergency readmissions, and poor patient outcomes.

[Wyndly (YC W21)](https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient‚Äôs unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.

Wyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. 

You can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).

### The Wyndly Model 

At Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we‚Äôre committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient‚Äôs initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers ‚Äì truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.

Once we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.

### Our values

**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.

**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.

**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that‚Äôs how we grow.

**Progress**: We make something better every single day.

*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*

### The team

Wyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who‚Äôs a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021)."

After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO¬Æ, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

Osmind is a San Francisco‚Äìbased public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator."

Our Philosophy:

1. Hyper-personalisation is the future.
2. User experience in healthcare is flawed.
3. Service providers (not just doctors) should care about health outcomes. 

We believe there are two kinds of industries that are ripe for disruption: the first is where there is an opportunity to reform, it's not user-friendly, and there is a distinct lack of trust. The second is where there are a lot of uneven profit margins being distributed, where a few companies are making a lot of money, they have high-profit margins and yet, customers are unhappy.

Healthcare in India, unfortunately, belongs to both of these buckets. And this is the reason why there are many new venture-funded companies trying to bring reform to this sector using various attack vectors.

There are three reasons why we feel healthcare in India is ripe for disruption:

1. Size: Over 200B is lost in income every year because of NCD-related loss in productivity.
2. Efficiency: The industry is inefficient and has built-in redundancies.
3. Experience: Other industries have become responsive and consumer-focused (Retail>E-Commerce) whereas healthcare has always lagged behind.

The way healthcare is being delivered is changing, with patients treated less often in hospitals and more as outpatients, while payers are moving towards a system that reimburses providers for helping reduce the cost of care overall.

At Medpiper, we are working with insurance companies to build a platform where end users can access healthcare goods and services and meaningfully connect with the local brick-and-mortar healthcare vendors by being a one-stop shop for everything from telehealth and diagnostics, chronic disease management to medical devices and actual drug supplies. Our aim is to improve long-term population health outcomes by providing personalized healthcare and a seamless user experience while at the same time maintaining quality and price transparency."

* Experienced founders and a culture of sharing mean there are plenty of opportunities to **learn all about building startups**, not just coding.

Healthcare providers contract with numerous payors, all of which have their own systems and processes for authorizing payment. Worse, payor systems don't communicate with provider EMRs, so providers are forced to do a lot of manual work between them to get paid. This results in providers spending $300 Billion a year to get paid, and ultimately collect less money than what they are owed.

CoreCare aggregates administrative patient data from all systems providers work with (EHR, Gov, Payer), standardizes it in our Enterprise Data Warehouse and creates a single net view of administrative patient data for the provider. Then we add workflow automations (according to client specifications) to eliminate the manual work providers are forced to do to get paid. "

Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. 

In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. 

With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. 

Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. 

The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We‚Äôve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020.

Most companies have all the data they need to figure this out, but it‚Äôs often locked away in 20 different systems. There is no central place for an account manager to easily prioritize which customers to focus on and what actions to take to help them. Workbase is the solution, by one-click integrating the data sources and customizing the interface and actions for each company.

We offer online doctor‚Äôs visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Zack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors."

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year.

Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders ‚Äì the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.

Our drug will target mitochondria ‚Äì the powerhouse of the cell ‚Äì to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.

We believe that today's evolution of the wholesale industry has stifled the growth of many SME businesses. The supply-chain in Malaysia and across Southeast Asia lacks meaningful real-time connectivity between suppliers and retailers. Hence we are determined to transform this industry by providing businesses the right tools to grow.

Our modern, digital approach to the wholesale industry allows retailers to discover, purchase, and manage inventories for their store - all on a single marketplace platform. And our software tool for suppliers helps businesses to deal with all the pain points of growing customer database, from ordering to payments.

With our data-driven approach, we connects local, independent retailers with the right brands, distributors, and wholesalers to stock their store with the best products. This saves retailers and suppliers time and money, allowing them to focus on what's most important: building and running their business.

The program is delivered remotely over the phone and through the mobile app, therefore users are able to follow the lifestyle program from the convenience of their home. Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.

The user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.

Our unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.

Breathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes). We are looking for ideas to improve our sales processes so that we can get users to enrol at a higher conversion rate post our 1-week free trial. We need to identify triggers when users are most likely to pay and provide them with a seamless process for paying on-the-spot."

We launched with money market funds and have ~40,000 customers who‚Äôve invested (~40% MoM growth). The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we‚Äôve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. 

Here‚Äôs the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. 

However, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.

We‚Äôre building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.

In terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor."

400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.

We're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge¬†1.75%¬†of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.

Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. 

More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.

We acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships. We leverage the banks' existing users, by integrating with their mobile app. In turn, we invest into their mutual funds.

Our first product is an API that healthcare startups use to submit insurance claims - kind of like Stripe for medical billing.

Healthcare providers in the US spend $280B a year -- 8% of their revenue -- on medical billing. It‚Äôs one of the largest inefficiencies in the American healthcare system. The incumbents in this fragmented space are service companies that throw armies of humans at the problem. Humans may be good at tackling the outrageous complexities of medical billing, but are expensive, slow, and error-prone. We‚Äôre charging less and getting providers paid more by using data science, modern workflow automation, and machine learning to rethink medical billing from the ground up.

Today, we charge 5% of the payments we process in exchange for handling everything relating to getting paid: translating doctor‚Äôs notes into billable codes, claim submission, appealing denied claims, collecting from patients, and providing sophisticated monitoring & analysis for all of it. This positions us extraordinarily well for our long-term vision of being a complete financial hub for healthcare providers: not only handling billing, but also using billing data to better underwrite loans and AR factoring."

At the time, the average life expectancy of an American was 62. 

A lot has changed in the last 83 years. The average American now lives until 79. The people turning 65 today were 45 during the first dot-com boom. The fastest growing segment on Tik-Tok is seniors. It took 20 years, but the internet has finally arrived for seniors.

But most of the products that seniors use are distinctly ‚Äúpre-web‚Äù - they‚Äôre cumbersome and exploitative.

When seniors buy healthcare, they have to talk to an insurance agent over the phone. These agents are exactly what you‚Äôd expect - they don‚Äôt know much about health insurance and they push Mom and Dad into the plan they get the highest commission on.

When seniors look to for liquidity, reverse mortgage brokers take advantage of their financial illiteracy.

When seniors look for companionship, they find themselves isolated in the suburbs they originally moved to to raise a family.

We are acutely aware of these problems because we see our own parents experience them. 

Fair Square is fixing them. 

Fair Square‚Äôs goal is to be a company seniors trust. To advise them on health insurance and financial planning. To find them a book club or an Art History lecture at a local community college. To have the customer experience of a five-star hotel and the care and respect of a relative.

We started by building a customer obsessed health insurance brokerage for seniors. We‚Äôve worked with 10,000 people across the United States. Our NPS score is 98, compared to an industry average of 13.

Tires are the perfect vertical to tackle first because they are future-proof (tires are going nowhere) and scale from luxury personal automobiles to freight-centric big-rigs. The current tire changing industry is entrenched with an aging workforce but maintains strong margins. We will build and deploy a robotic tire changing container that can change tires in 10 minutes. 

Our fully-integrated ROBOTIRE containers can be placed inside existing shops, Walmart parking lots or in the middle of a fleet service area hundreds of miles away from a major city.

Employees get unlimited primary care visits at our asset-light clinics, alongside traditional hospitalization insurance.

During YC, we grew from 0 to $85,000 ARR with 200% MoM growth. We serve 22 companies and 5500 members across Pune. 

Employers pay us $15/member/year and we make an additional $25 on prescriptions, lab tests, and hospitalization referrals. Our total gross margins are 70%.

200MM Indians are covered with employer-funded health insurance, representing a $8 billion dollar market opportunity, growing at 27% CAGR.

Indian employers are dissatisfied with their health benefits today because insurance in India only covers hospital stays, not doctor visits ‚Äì and only 8% of their employees will ever use the benefit in the year. With Loop, employers can offer a more engaging health benefit that includes doctor visits and telemedicine, alongside traditional hospital coverage, for about the same price. Because their employees have better access to doctors, we can also offer lower insurance premiums."

We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won‚Äôt find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.

Legacy (YC S19) is a Series B startup focused on the fast-growing field of fertility and family planning. Founded at Harvard, the company has now raised almost $50M from leading investors like FirstMark Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Section 32, Tribe Capital, and even celebrities like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and others. For context, we've closed 4 venture rounds in 2.5 years, in addition to our celebrity round of funding. 

**What we're doing**

We are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers/parents. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

**Why are we the leader?** 

The company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:

1. Insurance (We cover over 10M individuals through insurance in NY and CA)
2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs & other SpecOps through exclusive programs)
3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers like Progyny, Carrot, and Maven)

**Tell me about the team** 

We're a team of under 50, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning.

Breast cancer, for example, is driven by 198 genes being activated when they shouldn‚Äôt be, and we don‚Äôt know why.

But that‚Äôs about to change. Just a few years ago, biologists discovered new molecules that turn genes on and off. Collectively, these molecules are known as the ‚Äúepigenome,‚Äù and they‚Äôre the control switches that determine how our cells work and give rise to disease. 

At Arpeggio, we‚Äôve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work. This gives scientists a clear understanding of how drugs and diseases function and has enabled our customers ‚Äì including four of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world ‚Äì to match the right treatments to the right patients, screen new compounds, and reposition existing drugs into new indications.

- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.
- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.

India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

How do you know people need what you're making? 
We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand."

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

Our team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.

Building a home requires human labor to: measure, cut, lift, drill, paint, and attach. This labor is used for a building‚Äôs: structure, vapor barriers, windows, insulation, siding, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fixtures, appliances, and cabinetry. The construction industry solves this complex variety of tasks by dividing them among tiny companies of specialized artisans. Few lessons learned are shared and the industry has had no growth in labor productivity since 1947.

Building technology, methods, and materials have advanced and the constraints limiting home manufacturing can now be removed. Regulations have changed to allow small and simple accessory dwelling units (a.k.a. ADUs or backyard homes), making it easier to mass-produce housing.

As parents, we want to know more about our babies. But it‚Äôs hard to believe that, despite all the technology available, we still do not know our baby without a visit to the doctor or hospitals. Which is time consuming, expensive, and stressful.

That‚Äôs why we created Modoo. 

Mothers simply wear the device on their belly. It tracks baby‚Äôs heart rate, movements and generates baby‚Äôs health report, so we can consult a physician with just one click.

Modoo connects to an app that allows users to share data via social media sites like WeChat and Weibo, which makes it easy to help family and friends feel more connected.

And thanks to the information it collects, our users reported that, it has helped preventing the loss of 73 babies so far. 

We has been selling Modoo in China at price of 200 dollars since 2017. last year, we tripled our revenue to 3.4 million dollars. 

To target at a bigger market, we launched a subscription trial 3 months ago, with an initial price of 60 dollars. It‚Äôs growing 69% week on week, and already generating 50 thousand dollars in MRR. 

Pregnancy is a lucrative market. 16 million babies are born in China every year, that‚Äôs a $3.2 billion dollars home market. Worldwide 140 million births make a 28 billion dollars market.

We also always build an embedded fintech component (e.g. we process payments on behalf of our clients) so that we earn revenue with every dollar our clients raise.

Our mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staffs, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.

Since our founding, we've served over 300 clients at every level from city council to US Senate (who have collectively managed $1B+ of contributions on our platform).

Traction: Since our launch, we have achieved over 2,000,000 processed trips with more than 200,000 users, we bootstrapped until we achieved half a million trips and entered YC.

Five of these reactors are 45-65 years old and are quickly coming to the end of their operational life. This has cultivated a fragile and lengthy supply chain, at odds with the nature of radioactive material.

This issue and its implications do not just effect molybdenum, but any other reactor-based isotope. Many promising cancer therapies are stuck in clinical trials, unable to secure enough material in a timely manner. Research doesn‚Äôt even happen because of the difficulty of sourcing any new isotopes.

Avo helps teams like Ikea, Wolt, Fender, Sixt and Cond√© Nast to plan, implement and monitor analytics, so they don't fly blind and fail to build great user experiences

Start your step-by-step path to settle your analytics debt:

Step 1: Better tracking plan management.
Avo is a better alternative to the ""tracking plan spreadsheet"", keeping your data quality high and your schema sync'd with all downstream tools. Import your tracking plan for an instant audit, then design more scalable data for every feature release, even before you're an expert.

Step 2: Better data validation.
Avo is ongoing observability of actual tracking compared with tracking plan. One-time install the Avo Inspector SDK to see what's wrong with your tracking today so you can start making it better.

Step 3: Better analytics release workflow.
Avo is the self-serve analytics governance, changing how PMs, devs and data scientists collaborate to plan, implement and verify their product analytics. What used to take Patreon 1-4 days for every feature release, now takes 30-60 minutes."

We helped them track the credit given to their customers and suppliers. With our Okcredit app a merchant can track the amount of credit given, monitor credit limit, send reminders and eventually can collect faster from their customers. So as a company our vision was to bring the data dark merchants onto the digital platform. We have changed the way the MSMEs record the transactions and eased their life today.

But, today, plant-based dairy is prohibitively expensive due to the use of nuts as the primary ingredient. 
 
I created Spero (sperofoods.co) because I wanted everyone to be able to eat clean dairy alternatives that actually taste good. So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.
 
At Spero, we make dairy from seeds. 
 
Why seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.
 
Spero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it‚Äôs comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.
 
By using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products. Spero will be the first company to make dairy alternatives mainstream.

Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation.

From our early days of automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, to pioneering a brand-new market as the leading Trust Management Platform, our vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security remains unchanged. Now more than ever, making security continuous‚Äînot just a point-in-time check‚Äî is essential. Vanta is the leading Trust Management Platform that helps simplify and centralize security for organizations of all sizes. Over 4,000 companies including Autodesk, Chili Piper, Flo Health and Quora, rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust‚Äîall in a way that's real-time and transparent.

Our love for podcasts began when we discovered their power to make our ordinary day-to-day tasks more enjoyable and meaningful. Podcasts helped transform tedious activities like commutes or household chores into more positive experiences, helping us learn new skills, stay informed, or pass the time with captivating stories. We want to help people in their pursuit of happiness.

We‚Äôve been podcast aficionados for years, and, even for us, finding the right one to listen to is difficult and frustrating. With tens of millions to choose from and more being released every day, the problem‚Äôs only getting worse.

It‚Äôs time to fix this problem. Americans spend 30 billion hours every year commuting and doing household chores. We want to make those hours worthwhile. By building technology that makes it easy to access great podcasts, we‚Äôll help millions of people reclaim lost time and experience more fun, inspiration, and personal growth every day.

Dry eye affects more than 25 million Americans and the global treatment market is projected higher than $6 Billion within the next decade. Our thermally responsive, form-fitting materials are suitable for sustained yet reversible occlusion across a range of treatment times. In contrast to existing technologies, our product will not extrude, or cause discomfort as it adapts to patients. Though Humidifeye is not yet FDA approved, expect to hear about it soon!

In coordination with partners across several sectors, we have a variety of groundbreaking technologies in the works that live up to our vision. This work has already been recognized. AesculaTech was named a Rosenman Innovator, received a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant, was a finalist in the 2019 Octane High Tech Awards, and is a graduate of both the Y Combinator and TMCx accelerator programs. In short, Y-Combinator was only the beginning.

The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience ‚Äî with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn‚Äôt carry around the sensation that they‚Äôre stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn‚Äôt to encourage nicotine use among people who haven‚Äôt started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn‚Äôt the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco ‚Äî first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine‚Äôs pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA‚Äôs public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health ‚Äî and reduce its costs ‚Äî through a superior pure nicotine product."

Goodcover is a Managing General Agent (MGA) that administers personal insurance on behalf of our Membership, a bit like how USAA does it.

Member's premiums are pooled and used to pay claims.  We take a fixed fee, and the remainder is returned in our Annual Member Dividend.

We work with multi-billion dollar capital partners to ensure regulations are followed, adequate claims capital is always available, and we have emergency capacity for catastrophes.

Technology allows us to eliminate waste, saving roughly 25% of the cost.  We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.

As an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our ""Marketing Budget"" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.
We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.

Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:
    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor
    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)
    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)
    - added coverage for mold removal

Our MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, ""renting"" capacity as we need it.

That‚Äôs where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don‚Äôt always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can‚Äôt just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com.

These fabrics literally change shape in response to a change in temperature: the fabrics become thicker and insulate more as the temperature drops, and they become thinner and insulate less as the temperature rises again. This ""intelligent insulation"" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. 

Skyscrape‚Äôs fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.

First, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000¬∞F.

Once the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.

The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.

Our key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren‚Äôt giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we‚Äôve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we‚Äôre working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet."

As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences. Many publishers try to keep up with peak demand by paying for more servers, many of which are almost never used and struggle with video playback. Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. 

Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.

Our video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers."

To enable this industry transformation, the infrastructure required to fuel and service vehicles must evolve as well. Since the total spend for all fuel and maintenance can more than double the cost of ownership of a vehicle over its lifetime, the impact at stake is huge.

This is where we derived our mission:
To help our members to keep moving in the safest, most efficient, and planet-friendly way possible, while delivering unparalleled customer service.

We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).

The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. 

Razorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.

Razorpay‚Äôs valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley‚Äôs largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company‚Äôs valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.

This commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: 

Acquired Ezetap in 2022 - India‚Äôs leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India‚Äôs leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business‚Äôs entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. 

Customer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:

- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay‚Äôs several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:

- First to launch India‚Äôs Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ 
- Razorpay became India‚Äôs first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI
- Razorpay also became India‚Äôs largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India‚Äôs leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. 
- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay.

From data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.

Our customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured."

A typical Publishing Team consists of an author, editor, designer and business/marketing manager for the book. You don‚Äôt get assigned projects in our system; you choose the people you work with.  We work much more quickly than traditional publishers, taking advantage of new technologies to streamline the process of getting books into the hands of readers.

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.
Whether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. 

Enter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

Big companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone.

We provide access to protein engineering, DNA assembly, transient experiments and stable transformation as a service. The best thing is that anything ""Powered by TAXA"" is designed to be free from expensive regulatory approval, meaning the products are available for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States immediately after they are developed. For a detailed list of the experiments which can be run on our platform please see the Services page.

Our vision is a world where bio-engineering is as easy and commonplace as mobile application development is today. Game-changing technologies, like genetic engineering, should not be the exclusive preserve of large corporations and a wealthy elite. Democratizing the tools of creation enables anyone, anywhere, to genetically engineer plants and will unleash a wave of creativity to power an environment where ultimately what we create is limited only by our imagination.  The TAXA platform is our next step in the realization of that dream

Coin 2.0 smart payment device
Coin 2.0 is a secure smart device that has the form factor of a credit card, but it holds your cards in one - including your credit, debit, gift and loyalty cards. Coin 2.0 lets you swipe or tap your cards at millions of merchants across the USA. Coin 2.0 has 80%+ compatibility, partly because we use cutting-edge technology that has not yet been integrated into all point-of-sale systems. We encourage customers to carry a ‚Äúbackup card‚Äù given the wide variety of sales registers in the USA. While Coin 2.0 shares the same form factor as a credit card, it features enhancements such as an electronic display and a single button to allow for simple switching between different cards. With over-the-air updates, Coin 2.0 adapts to evolving payment technology, offering future-ready ubiquity in a small and powerful package. Coin's security features also keep your information safe. Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA. To verify identify, a Social Security Number is required.

This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.

The business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.

By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.

imgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program. Its customers include Google, Lyft, Kickstarter, AirBnb, Coursera, Bonobos, Spotify, Vimeo, Bustle, and many others."

Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world.

The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

*Lose what you want

Participate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual."

The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.

The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay."

The service has grown since then. The team now manages and serves mobile and web app data on behalf of thousands of developers and hundreds of customers to their users around the world. In 2014, the company was acquired by a global enterprise software & hardware vendor."

In July 2006, the TextPayMe team started working for Amazon and, as of 2011, the site redirects to an Amazon's mobile payment website. There was no press release related to this event but it's assumed the company was acquired.

Sending and receiving payments through TextPayMe is easy: simply write a text message to SMS@TextPayMe.com with ""pay amount phonenumber"" in the body (i.e. to send $5 to 123-456-7890, text ""pay 5 1234567890""). The service is secure as well, as each payment needs to be confirmed by a user-created PIN. To fund your transactions, TextPayMe lets you add money directly from your bank account and now also lets you link your credit card as well.
