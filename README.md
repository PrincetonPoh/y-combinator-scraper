# Context
I was tasked to scrape the Y-combinator founders. It's great to have an example to learn from. I found [this](https://github.com/dit-x/y-combinator-scraper) to help me get started. I've streamlined the repo to make the code more readable and simpler. If you want the full bells and whistles, checkout his original repo.
# Skills Requirements
You will have 3 main skills to get started. I've attached tutorial links to learn more about each resource:
1. [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRLHr664tXA) for HTML extraction
2. [Selenium automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjv1sY630Uc) for scrolling pagination
3. [Multi-threading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEEhzQoKtQU) for SPEEEED!

# Information to scrape
The image below indicates the imformation to be scraped for analysis. If the script fails in the future, it's likely that the HTML class has changed. Watch the above [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRLHr664tXA) video to learn how to tweak the code for yourself.
