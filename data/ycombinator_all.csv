We’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.
We have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.

Mezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.

We have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

To find products, they go to one place; for services, they go to several others; and for healthcare, a few more. In Colombia, in average, a person must visit or consult more than seven places per year to meet the needs of their pets.

In the services section, we have more than 17 services, all the healthcare, beauty and entertainment services.

Until now, tools for building products have been fragmented. Product analytics, heat maps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing tools weren’t natively built to work together.

PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that you can host yourself.

We started PostHog as part of Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks old.

Legacy (YC S19) is a Series B startup focused on the fast-growing field of fertility and family planning. Founded at Harvard, the company has now raised almost $50M from leading investors like FirstMark Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Section 32, Tribe Capital, and even celebrities like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and others. For context, we've closed 4 venture rounds in 2.5 years, in addition to our celebrity round of funding. 

**What we're doing**

We are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers/parents. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

**Why are we the leader?** 

The company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:

1. Insurance (We cover over 10M individuals through insurance in NY and CA)
2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs & other SpecOps through exclusive programs)
3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers like Progyny, Carrot, and Maven)

**Tell me about the team** 

We're a team of under 50, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning.

From data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.

Our customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",2,3,4,USA

Backpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. 
Each backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.
Travelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a ""backpack request"" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they ""request backpack"" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  

backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.

Thread combines the best bits of tech with the best bits of personal styling: After signing up by completing a short questionnaire and uploading photos of yourself, you’re paired with a stylist who reviews your information and uses Thread’s proprietary algorithm to sort through thousands of items to create the best outfits for you. When you log onto Thread, everything you see is tailored to your sizes, budget, preferences and tastes.

By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.

Tang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again.

Guardian Bio’s approach is focused on creating a dendritic cell-based product which drives anti-tumor activity through activating the killers of the immune system AND training them against multiple cancer targets. We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

This isn't drones for burritos though, unless you want literally tons of burritos! We are addressing heavy payloads - the hardest stuff to fly electrically. 

Whether you’re in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown. Electric aircraft could be a solution for lowering cost, but we’re stuck with small payloads and low range for many years to come. So for the hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or inter-island communities that could benefit the most, the electric aviation revolution just isn’t coming. Unless...

Without requiring FAA certification or integration into formal airspace, Seaflight’s simple uncrewed ""ground effect"" craft will enable high value, time-sensitive cargo to be flown overwater, point-to-point between coastal communities at 10x the speed of a ship, with triple the margin of conventional air freight, and almost double the range or payload of a conventional electric aircraft. Express air cargo continues to grow at double digit pace, it's time to deliver it in the most efficient way possible for cost and climate.

2) We’re actively working with the Coast Guard and branches of the armed forces to be able to safely test and develop our systems and operations in controlled ways, to reduce risk - but if the US moves slowly, we have an MoU for unrestricted testing in Europe. 
3) After that we’ll partner with an existing logistics operation to fly initial routes that are not heavily trafficked by ships, to build up our reliability and safety before scaling to other markets.

Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. 

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Until Sunlight.

With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.

**Team**

Yo and Misato have previously built a retail-tech company together and sold it for $20M to Rakuten. Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.
Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.

**The Problem**

70% of the Japanese 100 billion software market is spent on customized development!

However, Japan is not alone when it comes to customizing the legacy ERP system in a large enterprise.

Legacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.

On top of this, whether it’s from global or local vendors, most ERP users are frustrated with:

- Clunky and complicated UI
- Too many features that you’ll never use
- Too less features that you actually need
- Poor 3rd party integration options
- No transparency / black box system
- Just super expensive

**The Solution**

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

What does it mean to our clients?

- Faster development
- Reduced maintenance cost
- Well-documented backend APIs

Tailor’s key capabilities:

- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development
- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises
- Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process
- Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow",2,0,7,Japan; Remote

It aims to solve the main challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.

Our overarching goal is to extend our platform technologies to express and purify mRNA directly from a eukaryotic host such as yeast. This would lead to a significant reduction in cost of mRNA manufacturing and potentially an even greater improvement in quality. There is accumulating evidence that naturally occurring mRNAs, with all the native folded structures and endogenous modifications, are better at expressing proteins without triggering innate immune responses compared to synthesized mRNAs - creating a more effective and accessible treatment for patients worldwide.",1,2,5,USA

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

Globally, the electric vehicle market is exploding. Particularly in India, where more than 40% of the new automobile sales are expected to be electric by 2030!

The thing that fascinates us is that virtually 100% of them are connected to the cloud, which captures and stores telematics, battery, and other mobility data. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for companies to interact with them as there is no user-friendly API or developer portal provided by any brand. For all of these vehicles, we create a single, standardized API.

Here are some immediate use cases we are powering:
1. Smart route planning, to reduce range anxiety and save money by optimizing battery usage for EV owners. 
2. Insurance companies use our telematics data to reward good drivers and also to assess battery degradation. 
3. Finally, fleets are electrifying, necessitating centralized and remote monitoring. Our API enables this transition by providing a unified interface for all vehicles irrespective of brand.
